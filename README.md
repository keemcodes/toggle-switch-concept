# toggle-switch-concept
* This is a concept for a toggle switch that I can use later...
* Thanks to the guy Marcus from this codepen here: https://codepen.io/mburnette/pen/LxNxNg
* Marcus made a cool "hack" using html checkbox with css to create a toggle switch
* I use javascript to anchor to the input box using an eventlistener.
* The event listener checks for if the checkbox has been selected
* I then use the fetch feature to post values to PHP...
* the php code can be adapted to insert data into a db or interface with an API OR WHATEVER :)
